<p class="linkedP">When a kingpin threatens New York City, a group of mutated turtle warriors must emerge from the shadows to protect their home. Mr. Cage stars in the role of Michaelangelo who is the master of nunchucks and a lover of pizza </p>
<p class="linkedP">April O'Neil (Megan Fox), a reporter for Channel 6 Eyewitness News in New York City, investigates a crime wave by criminals called the Foot Clan. At a dock at night, she sees the Foot raiding cargo containers. After an unseen vigilante attacks the thieves, April notices a symbol left behind. April's supervisor Bernadette Thompson (Whoopi Goldberg) and her coworkers are oblivious to her story. Later while covering a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, April expresses gratitude to the company's CEO Eric Sacks (William Fichtner), who was her late father's (Paul Fitzgerald) lab partner.
