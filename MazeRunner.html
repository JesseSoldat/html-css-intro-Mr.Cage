<p class="linkedP">Mr. Cage is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow "runners" for a shot at escape. </p>
<p class="linkedP">Mr. Cage&rsquo;s journey as Thomas who gradually discovers that the Glade is run by two boys who maintain order by enforcing strict rules. Outside the Glade is the Maze, a labyrinth of high walls covered in ivy that houses strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers. The boys are trying to stay alive as well as "solve" the Maze by running through it as fast as they can while tracking movements of the walls and trying to find an exit to escape.
